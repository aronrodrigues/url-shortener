# URL Shortener

In the language of your choice, create a URL shortening service (Yes we know examples can be found on google) – please don’t spend more than 1 or 2 hours. Make sure to add comments in your code explaining any design decisions. Be ready to talk through any changes you would make before deploying as a production service.

Make sure to remove any secrets before submitting! 

## Requirements:

Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This is called a short link. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.
When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
The service should run on the cloud (of your choice). Include scripts to deploy and run the application on the cloud.
 
### What we are looking for:

* There are no tricks or hidden agendas – we’re just looking to examine your technical knowledge and engineering principles. Please make sure your code is clear and demonstrates good practices. Your solution will form the basis for a subsequent interview.
* We're not expecting a production-grade solution, nor are we restricting the use of any existing libraries.

### Checklist:

Once done, please make your solution available on GitHub and forward the link. Where possible, please include your commit history to give visibility of your thinking process and progress. Please ensure you have submitted the following:

Working app as per requirements above
A readme.md explaining:
How to build and run your solution
Reasoning behind design and any trade-offs
Explanation of what could be done with more time
Working project that builds/tests/runs as per instruction
 
Good luck and thank you for your time – we look forward to seeing your solution.
